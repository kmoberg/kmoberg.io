            <h3>IT & DevOps</h3>
            <p>My passion for IT has been around since I first tried my grandparents computer during summer break at the age of 6, and it has only grown since. I love to maintain computer systems, figuring out how they work, and what I can do to improve them.</p>
            <p>In the later years, after I learned of the DevOps movement where I love working both on the dev and ops side of a project! My goal for many years have been to help businesses move to a more flexible way of developing, maintaining and improving applications - a way to move from the old huge monthly or yearly releases, to multiple releases times a day that can significantly improve your teams efficiency!</p>

            <h3>Phtotography</h3>
            <p>My second passion for decades has been photography and video production. In my time, I've worked with everything from professional photo shoots to large multi-camera productions. I've participated in film shoots and made multiple large projects, both a producer, DOP, editor and director. In the last few years, my time has been spent as a photographer and you check out my work at <a href="https://km-foto.no" target="_blank">KM-Foto</a> where I host my best work.</p>
